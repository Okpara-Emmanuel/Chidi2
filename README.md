## Udacity Project: Pixel Art Maker
This is my Final project for Udacity's Google Front-End Web Development Scholarship (first phase). The project specifications were to build a grid dynamically based on user input, and allow the user to modify colors of the grid cells. I decided to make structure selector on separate line to act as a proper guide when selecting grid.

## Features:
Responsive design
Google Firebase database integration
well structured input for grid selector
Clear grid
